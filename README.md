# Monkey patched version of Angular Bootstrap 0.12.1

Due to an extreme watch count in the date picker and having a use case with a lot of date pickers attached to input fields, I decided to create monkey patched version of the bower library of angular bootstrap.

Issue was https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/issues/2613

Monkey patched changes from https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/pull/1915

Please note, only `ui-bootstrap-tpls.js` has been patched!
